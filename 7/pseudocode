== Advent of Code Day 7 ==

This asks you to find subdirectories of / that contain files of
100000B (100KB) or less and add up their files' byte counts.

if:
a/
	e/
		254 i.txt
then:
you add both a's 254B and e's 254B.

Main problem is that you need to figure out the file tree.
Convert it into a .txt or smth that you can read.

Idea:
Make a Directory Java class that contains an
ArrayList<Integer> and an (Maybe use ArrayList<Map<String, Integer> later)
ArrayList<Directory>
thus, you can have
Directory {
    ArrayList<Integer> {8936, 19873}
    ArrayList<Directory> {
    Directory { ... },
    Directory { ... }
    }
};
