This one is asking you to find which trees are "visible",
meaning that there are no trees 1higher than it
either up, down, right, or left.

To solve this, let each tree have its row and its column.

30373
25512
65332
33549
35390

create an int[y][] for rows and an int[x][] for columns.

tree at (1, 1) has row {2, 5, 5, 1, 2} and col {0, 5, 5, 3, 5}
its value is 5, and both its row and col indices are @1
so scan to the left of it, then the right of it for each list

Scan in this order: 
row left: max of {2} is 2, 2 < 5 and visible;
row right: max of {5, 1, 2} is 5, 5 = 5 and not visible;
col left: max of {0} is 0, 0 < 5 and visible;
col right: max of {5, 3, 5} is 5, 5 = 5 and not visible;

Use Arrays.sort(int[]) to scan

if any of these check out, increment a counter.
