== Advent of Code Day 9 ==

The problem of today is to find out what tiles the T goes over.

if T is within 1 (vertically or horizontally) of H:
    T position does not change.
if T is not within 1 of H:
    T position is the previous position of H.

For instance:
.T.. > ....
..H. > ..TH

TH.. (> T.H.) > .TH.

so now we need tPos, hPos, and oldHPos variables (arraylists)
All of these values will start at (0,0) and can only be positive ex. (1,2)
parse these into a "find distance" function (Math.abs(tX-hX),Math.abs(tY-hY))

save the hPos to oldHPos
have a moveHPos(dX, dY) that moves it to its new position
have a findTPos() function that uses hPos and oldHPos to tell where tPos should be
save current tPos into a set
