== Advent of Code Day 13 ==

Ok so the initial String will be something like
[1, [2, 3], [4, 5, [6]]]
The first PacketList should have elements [1] and [2, 3], each PacketLists.
Comparing 1 and [2] is the same as comparing [1] and [2], so there's no matter in keeping Integers.


So how do we get the PacketLists? hmmm

int stringIndex = 0;
int layer = 0;

advanceChar(nextChar)
{
    if (nextChar == '[')
        layer++;
    else if (nextChar == ']')
        layer--;
}

if (layer == 1)
    put PacketLists into this list of the items I scan;
else if (layer == 2)
    ignore;
